bug: sets of arrays don't work

Sets of arrays don't currently work because the 'in key: keyType'
arguments result in bad code, seemingly because we don't support
generic records instantiated with array types well today.  See
test/types/records/generic/genericRecordOfArr*.chpl for simpler
motivating cases in a similar vein (although those don't generate
valgrind errors while this test does for some reason).
